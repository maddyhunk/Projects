Project Name :- Automation(Virtual Assistant) 
It's a limitlesss project......huge potential of growth this project has.

Inspired from our field of study i.e AI&ML
also from the Professional Assitants like Google assistant , siri , Alexa etc ..
and ye slike we saw jarvis in iron man.

We can't match their Perfomance , efficiency and their algos. But yes we have tried to built an assistant like them .

To reduce the man power or efforts , we both have developed this automated project like Google Assistant.

We have automated many tasks in our project , where we/you just need your voice to operate them and get your desried result.



			
The daily tasks we usually do as youth/student in our device
	1.open browser , youtube
	2.playing multimedia
	3.open apps like whatsapp
	4.searches on wikipedia
	5.open visual studio code
	6.E-mails
	.
	.
	.
	.
	n
		Number of tasks as per the users.
So we have automated them , just need your command and in a moment you get your result.

		Basic Libraries we used
					import datetime
					import pyttsx3
					import speech_recognition as sr
					import wikipedia
					import webbrowser
					import os
					import smtplib
					from time import sleep 


The audio in this project is the By-default audio :- Microsoft Speech API
				The Speech Application Programming Interface or SAPI is an API developed by Microsoft 
				to allow the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis within Windows applications.


To send E-mail we use smptlib package(already install in python)
				
				:-
					We have to allow the less secure apps toggle of our own e-mail(used to send the mail)
	Some apps and devices use less secure sign-in technology, which makes your account vulnerable.
	You can turn off access for these apps, which we recommend, or turn it on if you want to use them despite the risks.
	Google will automatically turn this setting OFF if itâ€™s not being used
